# How to computer

A journal of learning sessions with a particular 10 year-old.

## Why?

Because software is hard.

Start early, have fun, code for the Greater Good.

## Format

Computer science seems to be a really tough learning topic for children due to its 
  sparsity of correct actions in the sea of possible wrongs. As such, I chose
  following focus points for these sessions:
- practical - only introduce theory when necessary for understanding
- short - limiting these sessions to 30 minutes to avoid mental fatigue
- single-topic

I am not a professional educator, neither I have required training, 
  so treat this journal as product of a dedicated amateur. 

## Index

1. Computer literacy
2. Python
